## 📊 Featured Projects
### 1️⃣ NHS Patient Wait Time Analysis
- **Goal:** Analyze patient wait times and identify bottlenecks in NHS services
- **Skills Used:** SQL, Python (Pandas & Matplotlib), Power BI, Tableau
- **Key Insights:**
  - **Average Patient Wait Time Across Hospitals:** Identify hospitals with the longest and shortest average wait times.
  - **Percentage of Patients Waiting Over 4 Hours:** Define the proportion of patients experiencing long delays, broken down by hospital and department.
  - **Peak Wait Time Hours & Days:** Identify trends in patient wait times based on time of day and day of the week.
  - **Wait Time Distribution by Age Group & Severity:** Compare how wait times differ across patient demographics.
  - **Improvement Recommendations:** Identify bottlenecks and suggest data-backed solutions.
- **Files:** 
  - `datasets/nhs_wait_times.csv`
  - `sql/nhs_wait_times_analysis.sql`
  - `python/nhs_wait_times_analysis.ipynb`
  - `visuals/nhs_wait_times_dashboard.pbix`
  - `visuals/nhs_wait_times_dashboard.png`

#### SQL Queries for NHS Patient Wait Time Analysis
- Extract patient wait times:
  ```sql
  SELECT patient_id, appointment_date, arrival_time, seen_time, 
         TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time) AS wait_time_minutes
  FROM nhs_wait_times
  WHERE appointment_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
  ```
- Identify average wait time by hospital:
  ```sql
  SELECT hospital_name, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time)) AS avg_wait_time
  FROM nhs_wait_times
  GROUP BY hospital_name
  ORDER BY avg_wait_time DESC;
  ```
- Detect high-risk delays (over 4 hours wait):
  ```sql
  SELECT patient_id, hospital_name, arrival_time, seen_time, 
         TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time) AS wait_time_minutes
  FROM nhs_wait_times
  WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time) > 240;
  ```
- Find peak wait time hours:
  ```sql
  SELECT HOUR(arrival_time) AS hour_of_day, 
         AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time)) AS avg_wait_time
  FROM nhs_wait_times
  GROUP BY hour_of_day
  ORDER BY avg_wait_time DESC;
  ```
- Wait time distribution by age group:
  ```sql
  SELECT CASE 
           WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Under 18'
           WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 40 THEN '18-40'
           WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 65 THEN '41-65'
           ELSE '65+' END AS age_group, 
         AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, arrival_time, seen_time)) AS avg_wait_time
  FROM nhs_wait_times
  GROUP BY age_group
  ORDER BY avg_wait_time DESC;
  ```

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning with SQL
- **Goal:** Clean and normalize messy datasets using SQL techniques
- **Files:** `sql/data_cleaning_project.sql`

### 3️⃣ Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Goal:** Perform EDA on a dataset to uncover trends and insights
- **Files:** `python/eda_project.ipynb`
